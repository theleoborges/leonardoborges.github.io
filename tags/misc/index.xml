      <title>Mission accomplished</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A year and four months ago &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.leonardoborges.com/writings/2014/12/27/staring-a-new-chapter/&#34;&gt;I joined Atlassian&lt;/a&gt; to pursue a very exciting opportunity: to deliver realtime collaborative editing to Confluence. I have talked about it last year at &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3QR8meTrh5g&amp;amp;index=16&amp;amp;list=PLZdCLR02grLoBx0Y5ZrpdmLxc160PIwzQ&#34;&gt;EuroClojure&lt;/a&gt; and this year at &lt;a href=&#34;http://qconsp.com/presentation/colabora%C3%A7%C3%A3o-em-tempo-real-com-clojure-e-clojurescript%E2%80%8B&#34;&gt;QCon Brazil&lt;/a&gt;. Even &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cognitect.com/&#34;&gt;Cognitect&lt;/a&gt; wrote &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.cognitect.com/blog/2015/7/21/atlassian-builds-realtime-collaboration-services-with-clojure&#34;&gt;a few words about it&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In a nutshell this involved writing Clojure code all day to build an awesome service we call Synchrony. Synchrony is capable of realtime data synchronisation - not just collaborative editing - and as such its applications are many! This has been proven again and again internally during the Atlassian ShipIt hackatons, and externally via &lt;a href=&#34;https://enso.me/&#34;&gt;Enso.me&lt;/a&gt;, which is powered by Synchrony.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Clojure Sydney Meetup, four years in</title>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;in-the-beginning&#34;&gt;In the beginning&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Nearly 4 years ago I founded the Sydney Clojure User Group. I had been playing with Clojure for a little while&#xA;and started a small study group to learn more. Initially this group was private and held at the ThoughtWorks office.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After a couple of meetups and conversations I decided to open up the group to the public and then realised we weren&amp;rsquo;t the only ones interested in Clojure and, even more important, interested in meeting like-minded people, share experiences and help each other.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>So long 2015: Year highlights</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I should have published this post still in 2015 but as I was on holidays traveling around Australia I didn&amp;rsquo;t really have the time to do it. Better late than never, right? (also Linode - the provider hosting this site - has been under a &lt;a href=&#34;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10825425&#34;&gt;severe DDoS attack&lt;/a&gt; so the site just came back up today)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;2015 has been a unusually quiet year in this blog. Thankfully that is because I have been extremely busy in many other areas. I&amp;rsquo;d like to take the opportunity and look back at 2015&amp;rsquo;s highlights.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Another year is about to end and as it is tradition in this blog it&amp;rsquo;s time to look at the year&amp;rsquo;s highlights!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;functional-programming&#34;&gt;Functional Programming&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have been advocating Functional Programming and Clojure for a while now and 2014 has been good to me. It was the first year where I was paid to work almost entirely in functional languages. Most of it was in Scala and a little less in Clojure.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;thanks-thoughtworks&#34;&gt;Thanks, ThoughtWorks&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After 4 years and 8 months I have made the hard decision to change jobs: Friday, 19th of December, was my last day at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.thoughtworks.com/&#34;&gt;ThoughtWorks&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In this time I have made many friends and have grown a lot as a professional. Consulting presents so many new challenges that often times the technical problems you are trying to solve are the easiest part of the whole project. I am thankful for that.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This past weekend - 19-20th of December - a group of highly motivated individuals gave up their Friday night and their entire Saturday simply to learn how to code in Clojure!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It was the first ever &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.clojurebridge.org/&#34;&gt;ClojureBridge&lt;/a&gt; edition in Sydney and if you haven&amp;rsquo;t heard of it before, its goal is to increase diversity in the Clojure community. It does so by offering free workshops targeted at beginners.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You should totally read &lt;a href=&#34;http://juliangamble.com/blog/2014/12/20/why-clojurebridge-is-awesome/&#34;&gt;Julian Gamble&amp;rsquo;s post&lt;/a&gt; about the event for details. He&amp;rsquo;s was one of the volunteers on the day and has done a great job of describing his experiences.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I finally got some free time so sit down and write this post. I was travelling with my girlfriend around the state of&#xA;Victoria, Australia - mostly around the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.visitvictoria.com/Regions/great-ocean-road&#34;&gt;Great Ocean Road&lt;/a&gt;. I had an amazing time and it&amp;rsquo;s a trip&#xA;I highly recommend anyone do.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As for this year&amp;rsquo;s highlights, let&amp;rsquo;s get started:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;clojure&#34;&gt;Clojure&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.meetup.com/clj-syd/&#34;&gt;clj-syd&lt;/a&gt; - the Sydney Clojure User Group - continues going strong and this is in great part thanks to the amazing community behind it.&#xA;You can have a look at our &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/clj-syd/clj-syd/wiki/2013&#34;&gt;wiki page for 2013&lt;/a&gt; to see what we&amp;rsquo;ve been up to.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Keeping the tradition of end-of-year blog posts, here are my year highlights for 2012:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;clojure&#34;&gt;Clojure&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I started &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.meetup.com/clj-syd/&#34;&gt;clj-syd&lt;/a&gt; - the Sydney Clojure User Group - back in January and it has seen a major uptake. We consistently get an average of 25 people each month and there&amp;rsquo;s no shortage of talks and topics to discuss. It&amp;rsquo;s a great crowd and I&amp;rsquo;m proud to have started it and of being part of it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s that time of the year to look back at what you&amp;rsquo;ve done and either be happy about it or&amp;hellip; well not. :)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To me anyway 2011 was a great year but I won&amp;rsquo;t bore you with the details so I&amp;rsquo;ll just jump straight into a couple of highlights!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The biggest one of course was the project we developed to help the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.leonardoborges.com/writings/2011/01/16/clouds-against-the-floods/&#34;&gt;Queensland flood victims back in January&lt;/a&gt; - which brings me to the next topic:&lt;/p&gt;</description>
