      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently I wrote an internal blog post at work titled &lt;em&gt;On the traps of working from home&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;While the content isn&amp;rsquo;t new it was triggered by the recent events around COVID-19 and the fact that all of a sudden the whole company was working from home, distributed across multiple timezones.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I was worried that we may default to having more meetings instead of better communication and writing this post was my attempt to share how I tend to deal with distractions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
