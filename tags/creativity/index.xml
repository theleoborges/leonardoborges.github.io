      <description>Recently I wrote an internal blog post at work titled On the traps of working from home.
While the content isn&amp;rsquo;t new it was triggered by the recent events around COVID-19 and the fact that all of a sudden the whole company was working from home, distributed across multiple timezones.
I was worried that we may default to having more meetings instead of better communication and writing this post was my attempt to share how I tend to deal with distractions.</description>
